# TODO: (jklare) This recipe is a WIP one, since we probably want to support
# ml2_linuxbridge, but are not testing it right now. It will install the needed
# packages on debian and rhel/fedora, set the proper ml2 mechanism_drivers and
# set the proper attributes to create an empty linuxbridge_conf.ini in the
# proper directory when including the plugin_conf recipe in this cookbook. The
# config can be filled via attributes (e.g. like done for the ml2_openvswitch).
